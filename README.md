This repository contains several, independent submissions:

* twotofive-video1/src/EngineeringImpactCrash.java
* twotofive-video1/src/EngineeringImpactThud.java
* twotofive-video1/src/FirstHandImages.java
* twotofive-video1/src/LogoPuzzle.java

The repository also contains various other files and utilites used in the process of creating the submissions. However, these additional files are not necessary for running the actual submission classes, which are completely self contained.

These submissions were tested with Eclipse Kepler R2, and JDK 1.8u5.  In order to get some of the programs to compile, the Eclipse option that prevents access to the JavaFX jars had to be turned off.  The settings to do so are contained in the eclipse preferences file inside the repository, so pulling down the entire Eclipse project and running the programs from there should work.
